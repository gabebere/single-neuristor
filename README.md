# Single VO₂ Neuristor Simulation

This repository contains simulation code for a single VO₂ neuristor.

Created by Gabriel Berezovsky under the supervision of PhD candidate Amir Gildor in the Quantum Materials for Neuromorphic Computation Lab at the Technion.

This project models the electrical and thermal dynamics of a VO₂ neuristor and reproduces spiking behavior.
